Certbot (formerly Let's Encrypt)
================================

With Certbot you can easily add free SSL/TLS certificates to your web hosting accounts. Start by **installing Certbot** (you may have to add a couple of keywords to `/etc/portage/package.keywords/web`):

```sh
emerge letsencrypt
```

Issuing certificates is very easy and described under the [webhosting section](../05_Shared_Hosting/01_Webhosting.md).
